                        The roof covering was comprised of architectural composition shingles. Architectural shingles,
                        also called
                        dimensional shingles, are thicker and heavier (often 50% more) than traditional 3-tab shingles.
                        These 'premium'
                        shingles are manufactured by starting with a fiberglass reinforcement mat, multiple layer of
                        asphalt are added
                        over the mat, and lastly ceramic granules are added over the upper layer of asphalt for
                        protection against the
                        elements (wind, rain, UV rays from the sun). Architectural shingles typically have higher wind
                        resistance numbers
                        than their 3-tab counterparts, and resist leaks better. 30 - 50 year warranties are common with
                        these shingles,
                        but the warranty is highly prorated after 25 - 30 years. Typical replacement is usually needed
                        23 - 28 years after
                        the initial installation.

                        Due to the many variables which affect the lifespan of roof covering materials, I do not
                        estimate the remaining
                        service life of any roof coverings. This is in accordance with all industry inspection Standards
                        of Practice.The
                        following factors affect the lifespan of roof covering materials:

                    <ul style="font-family: calibri;font-size:15px;line-height: 15px;margin:5px 20px 15px 10px;">
                        <li>Roofing material quality: Higher quality materials, will of course, last longer.</li>
                        <li>Number of layers: Shingles installed over existing shingles will have a shorter lifespan.
                        </li>
                        <li>Structure orientation: Southern facing roofs will have shorter lifespans.</li>
                        <li>Pitch of the roof: Shingles will age faster on a lower pitched roof in comparison with
                            higher pitches.</li>
                        <li>Climate: Wind, rain, and snow will impact the lifespan of the roof.</li>
                        <li>Color: Shingles that are darker in color will have a shorter lifespan, than lighter colored
                            shingles.</li>
                        <li>Attic Ventilation: Poorly vented attic spaces will decrease shingle life due to heat.</li>
                        <li>Vegetation conditions: Overhanging trees, branches, contacting the roof, or leaf cover
                            drastically shorten
                            lifespan.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Asphalt shingles must be installed to manufacturers' recommendations, for the warranty coverage to be upheld.
                    These installation requirements vary widely from manufacturer to manufacturer, and across the multitude of
                    different shingle styles manufactured. I will inspect the roof to the best of my ability, but confirming proper
                    fastening, use and adequacy of underlayment, and adequacy of flashing is impossible as these items are not
                    visible, Damaging and invasive means would have to be carried out to confirm proper installation. Therefore, the
                    inspection of the roof is limited to visual portions only.

                        The shingles were inspected at visible portions for excessive granule loss, signs of curling or delamination, loss of
adhesion between the shingles, and any other signs of damage or excessive age. The shingles appeared to be in
satisfactory condition, allowing for normal wear and tear, at the time of inspection. No deficiencies were observed
unless otherwise noted in this report.
